Admin Payment Management Feature Implementation

Please add a payment management system to the admin dashboard (/admin/update-status) as a **separate section alongside the existing package management**.

---

## 1. Database/Backend Updates
* Add a **payments table/collection** with fields:
  * Payment ID (unique identifier)
  * Tracking ID (linked to package)
  * Customer name/email
  * Amount
  * Payment timestamp
  * Payment status: `Processing` (default), `Received` (admin confirmed)
* Link payments to tracking IDs for reference

---

## 2. Admin Dashboard UI - New Payment Management Section

### Add New Tab/Section
Add a **"Payment Management"** section on the admin dashboard (separate from package tracking section)

### Payment Table Display
Create a table showing all incoming payments with columns:
* **PAYMENT ID** - Unique payment identifier
* **TRACKING ID** - Associated package tracking number
* **CUSTOMER** - Customer name or email
* **AMOUNT** - Payment amount
* **PAYMENT METHOD** - How they paid (card, bank transfer, etc.)
* **DATE** - When payment was made
* **STATUS** - Payment status badge

### Payment Status Badges
* **Processing** (yellow/amber badge - default, waiting for admin confirmation)
* **Received** (green badge - admin confirmed payment)

### Admin Actions
For each payment row:
* **"Confirm Payment"** button - changes status from "Processing" → "Received"
* Button should only appear when status is "Processing"
* After confirmation, button disappears and status updates to "Received" 
* Now in the users dashboard add a new column so that when the status of payment is updated it reflects in users dashboard also just like the package status functionality

---

## 3. User Payment Flow
When users complete payment on their end:
* Payment data is sent to backend and stored
* Payment automatically appears in admin dashboard with **"Processing"** status
* Admin can see all incoming payments in real-time

---

## 4. Admin Confirmation Flow
When admin clicks "Confirm Payment":
* Update payment status to **"Received"**
* Show success notification to admin
* Update table in real-time without page refresh
* Optionally updates in the customer's dashboard 

---

## 5. UI Design Requirements
* Match existing admin dashboard styling (same colors, fonts, layout as package table)
* Use similar badge styling as package status badges
* Keep table clean and readable
* Mobile responsive design
* Add appropriate payment icons

---

## 6. Dashboard Layout Options
Add navigation menu to switch between sections

---

**Current Admin Dashboard Context:**
* Admins can currently update package status (Processing, En Route, Delivered, Delivery Failed)
* Table shows: TRACKING ID, DESTINATION, STATUS
* Has "Send Package" button

**Goal:** Add a completely separate payment management interface where admins can view all incoming payments and confirm them, independent of the package tracking functionality.
