I have an issue that is not working the first is that when I input my reference ID in the form after making payment it didn't send nothing created this is the form that usually has all the details I don't know if you get what I mean

If you check well nothing works after I input the reference ID this is the the webhook that is supposed to send and also the information that is supposed to send to the admin page

I want you to check this and also the scroll animation across all section in the home page isn't working and this is the 
I need to add scroll animations to my logistics app built in Replit. Please implement the following animations that trigger when elements come into view while scrolling:

## 1. FAQ Section (Homepage)
- Implement stagger animations where each FAQ item fades up and appears one by one with a slight delay between each item
- The animation should be smooth and professional

## 2. Cards (Throughout the entire site)
- Add fade-up animations for cards (they should start invisible from below and fade up into position)
- Add slide-in animations from left and right sides for alternating cards or specific sections
- Include scale/zoom effects where cards start slightly smaller and scale to full size

## 3. Requirements
- Animations should only trigger once when the element first comes into view (not every time I scroll past)
- Smooth, professional animations with appropriate timing (not too fast or slow)
- Should work smoothly across different screen sizes
- Performance optimized - shouldn't slow down the page

## 4. Implementation Preferences
- Use the Intersection Observer API for detecting when elements are in view
- Implement with CSS transitions/animations for smooth performance
- Add appropriate CSS classes that can be reused across different components
- Make it easy to apply these animations to new elements in the future

## 5. Please Provide
- The CSS for all animation types
- The JavaScript/React code for the Intersection Observer logic
- How to apply these animations to my existing FAQ and card components
- Any utility classes I can reuse for other elements

Do the reference form first before moving to the animations and make sure everything you do is responsive on mobile please that's the most used device
