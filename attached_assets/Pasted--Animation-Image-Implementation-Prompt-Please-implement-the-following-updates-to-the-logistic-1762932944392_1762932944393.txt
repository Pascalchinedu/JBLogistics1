# 🚀 Animation & Image Implementation Prompt

Please implement the following updates to the logistics app's front-end code, ensuring the animations are smooth and appear sequentially:

---

## 1. Sequential Rise-Up Animation for FAQ Section
Apply a **sequential animation** to the FAQ items so they appear one by one, rising from the bottom of the screen to their final position.

**Target Elements:** Each individual FAQ question container ("What areas do you deliver to?", "How do I track my package?", etc.)

**Animation Details:**
* Items should start **off-screen** (below) and **fade in** as they move up
* First item animates immediately on scroll into view
* Each subsequent item begins animation **only after the previous item has finished or is near completion** (staggered delay)
* Use **smooth, gentle easing** function (e.g., `ease-out`) for movement

---

## 2. Rise-Up Animation for Tracking Section Elements
Apply similar **rise-up animation** to key elements within the "Track Your Package" section.

**Target Elements:**
* Main navigational buttons (`Track`, `Ship`, `Account`)
* Heading text (`Track Your Package`)
* Main action button (`Go to Tracking Page`)

**Animation Details:** Stagger the appearance of these elements in logical flow (navigation buttons → heading → action button) using **rise-up/fade-in** effect.

---

## 3. Missing Image Placeholder Implementation
For sections where images are currently missing (based on screenshots provided):
* Add **placeholder image tag or component** in designated areas
* Placeholder should be visually neutral (gray box with subtle icon) until correct images are uploaded

---

## Implementation Requirements
* Use modern CSS/JS techniques: **CSS Keyframes/Transitions** or **Intersection Observer API**
* Ensure performance optimization and cross-browser compatibility
* Animations trigger once on scroll into view
* Mobile-responsive and smooth on all devices

**Note:** Screenshots will be provided to identify missing image locations.
