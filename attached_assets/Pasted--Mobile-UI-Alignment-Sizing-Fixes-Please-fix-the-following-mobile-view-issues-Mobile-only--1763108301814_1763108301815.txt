# 🔧 Mobile UI Alignment & Sizing Fixes

Please fix the following mobile view issues (**Mobile only - do not change desktop**):

---

## 1. Package Type Selection Modal (Homepage - "Send Package")
**Issue:** Modal not aligned properly, white space visible outside modal edges

**Fix:**
* Ensure modal is properly centered and fills appropriate width
* Remove white space/gaps on sides
* Modal should fit cleanly within viewport with proper padding
* Keep rounded corners and backdrop

---

## 2. Admin Dashboard - Payment Management Section
**Issues:** 
- Not aligned properly on mobile
- Filter tabs (All, Processing, Received, Declined) show numbers in parentheses - **remove these numbers**
- Content should be **horizontally scrollable** if tabs overflow

**Fix:**
* Fix alignment issues - ensure proper padding and width
* **Remove count numbers** from filter tabs: Change "All (2)" to just "All", "Processing (0)" to "Processing", etc.
* Make filter tabs horizontally scrollable (swipe left/right) if they don't fit on screen
* Keep yellow active state styling

---

## 3. Bank Transfer Details Modal
**Issue:** Modal fills entire mobile screen - too large

**Fix:**
* **Reduce modal height** - should NOT fill full screen
* Modal should be compact and only show:
  - Bank account details box (yellow background)
  - Payment reference input field
  - Important note box (blue)
  - Cancel and Submit buttons
* Add appropriate padding/margins so content breathes
* Keep modal centered with backdrop behind it
* Should feel like a focused card, not full-page takeover

## 4. Package Created Successfully Page
**Issue:** Fills entire mobile screen - too large

**Fix:**
* **Reduce content height** - should NOT fill full screen
* Make layout more compact:
  - Success icon (green checkmark)
  - "Package Created Successfully!" heading
  - Tracking number (with copy button)
  - Package Summary box (yellow background)
  - "Create Another" and "Back to Dashboard" buttons
* Add proper spacing but keep everything contained
* Content should fit comfortably with white space around it
* Should not feel cramped or stretched to fill screen

---

## General Requirements
* All fixes are **MOBILE ONLY** (< 768px breakpoint)
* Desktop views should remain unchanged
* Maintain existing color schemes and branding
* Ensure proper touch targets for mobile interaction
* Test on various mobile screen sizes (small to large phones)

---

**Goal:** Clean, properly sized mobile modals/pages that don't fill entire screen unnecessarily and are properly aligned without white space gaps.
